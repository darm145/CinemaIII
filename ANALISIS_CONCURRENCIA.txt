given the methods of the API controller we can notice that the race conditions may be present mainly on the cinemas list, the reason of this conclusion is because we always try to access to that list for many reasons(create,update,delete and read) , for example while I try to check the cinemas another person may be adding another one so this can became on stale data so the cinemas list is very important and must be accesed on a syncronized way in order to maintain its integrity.
there alsocan be race conditions such as many clients trying to buy the same ticket or someone checking the tickets available when other person is modifying them, or trying to check a cinema when another person is modifing or deleting it.
as we noticed when we syncronize the access to the list depending on the method we are implementing, for example for buying a ticket we just need to syncronize the tickets of that specific movie, but we want to alter some cinemas data we must syncronize all the list to ensure that all data is properly modified.
